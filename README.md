### Notify NYC

Small program to parse the RSS feed from NotifyNYC and post to Matrix

Note, the Matrix room should be the ID of the room, not the name.
On the first run, the bot will join the Room and publish anything that exists so far. Eg it will become a bit spammy on the
first run since there's not history
